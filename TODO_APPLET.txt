Regard those instructions if you intend to run the nano applet which allows you to control the RAFM

- be sure to include following in your website (the values can be different):	
  <applet archive="lib/nano.jar" code="nano.client.applet.ClientApplet.class" width="650" height="650">
	<param name="url" value="131.152.85.170">
	<param name="eventport" value="9100">
	<param name="streamport" value="9102">
	<param name="id" value="1470">
  </applet>

- Check your policy settings and your includes (lib/*.jar) if you run it in eclipse or similar.

- Check your PATH to include the jdk*/bin directory in order to be able to sign the applet's jar with JARsigner.

- if you run it from browser you need to ensure that you sign the applet in order for it to work.
  Running the file testRAFMApplet.html in your browser should show you if the jar file has been signed properly.

- if you build the applet jar file by using the build.xml target dist_applet you must know that the
  signed jar nanoApplet.jar will only be valid for one hundred years ;)
  
- you can use another keystore by using the following command in console:
    keytool -genkey -keystore nanoKeystore -alias rafmkey -validity 36500
    (of course you can adjust the parameters nanoKeystore, rafmkey and 36500 to your needs
     but consider changing them in the build.xml too)
